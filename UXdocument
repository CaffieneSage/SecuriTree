SecuriTree, the universe and everything!

 In our modern age, security is an imoprtant aspect of our daily life. Despite this it is often something that is overlooked, or undervalued.
 Keeping equipment and information secure can be a full time job in and of itself. Thankfully some of the grind at least can be automated
 to make our lives easier...and safer. To this end this document aims to show the thoughts and processes involved in building the SecuriTree 
 application.
  The securiTree application at its core is designed to make it easier to manage access points on a given site, by allowing remote control 
  and providing information on the current status on a given door.
  
Why would the end-user choose securitree?

 Ideally our platform should be simpler to use, and take the grind out of monitoring a customers hardware. Reliability (and simplicity!) is a given.
 Our solution should do the best possible job in keeping company assets safe and secure. Finally the end result should be intuitive to use, even for those 
 who are not necessarily that technically minded.
  If we take the example of a simple door locking mechanism, it is pretty obvious how a lock and key go together to prevent unauthorized access to what 
 is behind the door. By using a graphical interface, we should be able to achieve the same level of intuitiveness for the end user (hopefully!).

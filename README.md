# SecuriTree
Taking a look at binary tree data structures.

The Problem

Super Secure Systems(S3) is a company specialising in physical security and access control management. Their product lines range from
simple door locks to more advanced mechanisms including cameras with facial recognition and motion control etc.
S3 require us to build an application, this application will provide a visual view of all the security hardware that has been implemented
at a given site. It will allow authorized operatives to access, monitor and control individual hardware elements at the site remotely, and
will implement a Tree Heirarchy based data structure.

Functionality

Securitree will:
 * represent the relationships between security components visually as a tree structure.
 * Provide a password or pincode based access method to prevent unauthorized access.
 * Store data in a text file (probably an encrypted one).
